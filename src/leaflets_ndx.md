# Assigning lipids using NDX file(s)

Using NDX files for lipid assignment is arguably a simpler method that enables seamless integration of `gorder` with [`FATSLiM`](https://fatslim.github.io/), which implements possibly the best lipid classification method available.

## NDX file

To begin, create an NDX file containing at least two groups. One group should contain lipid atoms (preferably just their 'head identifiers') of the upper leaflet, while the other group should contain lipid atoms of the lower leaflet. 

```

```

## Using the NDX file

Then, specify the classification method in your configuration file:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromNdx
  ndx: "leaflets.ndx"
  heads: "name P"
  upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
  lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
  frequency: !Once
```

The leaflet assignment will be read from the NDX file `leaflets.ndx`, which should contain two groups: `UpperLeaflet` and `LowerLeaflet`. These groups should include the atoms of the upper and lower leaflets, respectively. The `heads` field specifies the head identifiers for all analyzed lipid molecules. Note that each lipid molecule must have only one head identifier; otherwise, an error will be returned. Since we are using a single NDX file, we also need to specify `frequency: !Once`, ensuring that the leaflet assignment from the NDX file is applied to all analyzed trajectory frames.

The `UpperLeaflet` and `LowerLeaflet` groups may contain various atoms, but they **must** include all `heads` atoms for the lipids being analyzed. In other words, every analyzed lipid must be assigned to a leaflet. The NDX file itself can contain any number of additional groups, but for performance reasons, it is recommended to keep both the file and the specified groups as small as possible.

## Scrambling-safe leaflet assignment

Instead of using a single NDX file, you can provide multiple NDX files, such as one file per trajectory frame. Your configuration file may then look like this:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromNdx
#          first frame         second frame        third frame         fourth frame
  ndx: ["leaflets0001.ndx", "leaflets0002.ndx", "leaflets0003.ndx", "leaflets0004.ndx", (...)]
  heads: "name P"
  upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
  lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
```

With this setup, leaflet assignment will be performed for each frame using a different NDX file.

## Specifying NDX files using `glob` pattern

Instead of manually listing many NDX file paths in the configuration file, you can use glob pattern matching:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromNdx
  ndx: "leaflets*.ndx"
  heads: "name P"
  upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
  lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
```

This pattern matches all NDX files in the current directory whose names start with `"leaflets"`, such as `leaflets0001.ndx`, `leaflets0002.ndx`, as well as `leafletsABCD.ndx`, `leafletsX.ndx`, and similar files, if they exist.

> Glob returns files in lexicographic order based on filenames. As a result, `leaflets10.ndx` may appear before `leaflets2.ndx`. Always verify the order of NDX files and ensure that filenames are structured so that lexicographic and numerical ordering align. For example, when dealing with frames 1â€“9999, use filenames like `leaflets0001.ndx` to `leaflets9999.ndx` to maintain the correct order.

## Assignments for every Nth frame

If you want to specify leaflet assignments for every Nth analyzed frame (e.g., every 10th frame), follow these steps:

1. Set the appropriate frequency in the configuration file. For example:
  ```yaml
  leaflets: !FromNdx
    ndx: ["leaflets0001.ndx", "leaflets0002.ndx", "leaflets0003.ndx", "leaflets0004.ndx", (...)]
    heads: "name P"
    upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
    lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
    frequency: !Every 10
  ```

2. **Ensure that the number of provided NDX files exactly matches the number of analyzed frames divided by N.** For example, if the trajectory is 10,000 frames long, [every 5th frame is analyzed](timerange.md), and leaflet assignment is performed for every 10th analyzed frame, you must provide 200 NDX files. If you provide less **or more** NDX files, you will get an error during the analysis.

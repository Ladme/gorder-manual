# Manual lipid assignment to leaflets

If you do not want to use the automatic leaflet classification (described in [Order parameters for individual leaflets](leaflets.md)), whether due to your system's complicated geometry or a lack of trust in the `gorder` assignment, you can manually specify the leaflet occupied by each lipid molecule (for each analyzed frame).

There are two ways to manually assign lipids to membrane leaflets: using [NDX files](leaflets_ndx.md) or a ["leaflet assignment file"](leaflets_assignment_file.md).

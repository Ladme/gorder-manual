# Selecting atoms using GSL

To specify and select atoms (or coarse-grained beads) in `gorder`, we use the Groan Selection Language (GSL). Its syntax closely matches that used by VMD and various other analysis tools. GSL additionally supports regular expressions and can reference NDX groups from provided NDX files.

**For complete GSL syntax and usage examples, see our [GSL guide](https://ladme.github.io/gsl-guide/).**

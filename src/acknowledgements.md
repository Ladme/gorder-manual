# Acknowledgements

`gorder` would not exist without the groundwork laid by many people across many projects. We extend our gratitude to the following:

- The team behind the [NMR Lipids](https://github.com/NMRLipids/) project, whose deposited structures and trajectories were used in the validation of the order parameters and the testing of the analyses.
  
- Patrick Fuchs and other developers of [`buildH`](https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH), whose incredibly detailed documentation has allowed the calculation of united-atom parameters to actually be reliable.

- Helgi Ingólfsson and Alex de Vries, who wrote the [`do-order`](https://cgmartini.nl/docs/downloads/tools/other-tools.html#do-order) script, which served as the foundation for calculating coarse-grained order parameters.

- Sébastien Buchoux, the developer of the [`FATSLiM`](https://fatslim.github.io/) package, which was an inspiration for dynamic membrane normal calculations.

- Marieke Westendorp, the developer of the [`molly`](https://git.sr.ht/~ma3ke/molly) crate, which is the main reason `gorder` is so fast.

- The developers of the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and many of its crates, without which this project would be painful to complete.

- The many people who contributed to the methodology of molecular dynamics simulations and their analysis over the years.

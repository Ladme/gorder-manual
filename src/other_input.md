# Using other input file formats

`gorder` is primarily designed for analyzing Gromacs simulations. The most efficient and straightforward way to use it is therefore by providing it with a TPR file and an XTC file. However, `gorder` also supports several other file formats for both [structure/topology](other_structure.md) and [trajectory](other_trajectory.md) files.

# Using `gorder` as a Rust crate

`gorder` can also be used as a Rust crate, allowing you to call it directly from your Rust code.

To use `gorder` in your project, first add it as a dependency:

```bash
$ cargo add gorder
```

Next, import the crate into your Rust code:

```rust
use gorder::prelude::*;
```

Once imported, you can access all the options and functionality described in this manual. For some examples on how to do that, refer to the corresponding [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/gorder/latest/gorder).

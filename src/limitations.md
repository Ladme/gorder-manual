# Limitations

While `gorder` aims to provide accurate and reliable results, there are some known limitations and scenarios where it may not be suitable. The current limitations are as follows:

1. **`gorder` cannot read TPR files generated with Gromacs versions older than 5.1.**
   - **Why is this the case?** This limitation stems from the [`minitpr`](https://github.com/Ladme/minitpr) crate used to parse TPR files. The TPR file format evolves constantly, and supporting all ancient Gromacs versions is simply not feasible.
   - **What can you do if your TPR file is this old?** In most cases, the solution is simple: convert the old TPR file using a new version of Gromacs, i.e., run `gmx convert-tpr -s old_file.tpr -o new_file.tpr`. If converting a TPR file is not an option for you, you can instead provide a PDB file with a connectivity section or a GRO file along with a bonds file (see [Using other input file formats](other_input.md)).
   - **Will this be addressed in the future?** Older Gromacs versions will likely **never** be fully supported.

2. **`gorder` only fully supports systems with orthogonal simulation boxes and periodic boundary conditions applied in all three dimensions.**
   - **Why is this the case?** This limitation arises from the [`groan_rs`](https://github.com/Ladme/groan_rs) crate, which provides only partial support for non-orthogonal simulation boxes. Handling periodic boundary conditions in such boxes is complex and not fully implemented at present.
   - **What can you do if your box is not orthogonal?** You must instruct `gorder` to [ignore periodic boundary conditions](no_pbc.md). Then, provide a trajectory where the lipid molecules are whole, and perform the analysis as usual.
   - **What can you do if your system is not periodic in some dimensions?** In most cases, there will be no issue; however, such systems have not been tested, and artifacts may occur. You can try [ignoring periodic boundary conditions](no_pbc.md) while ensuring the lipid molecules are whole and verify if the results change.
   - **Will this be addressed in the future?** `gorder` is unlikely to ever fully support non-orthogonal simulation boxes, simply because they are not common in membrane simulations. However, better support for partially periodic systems might be added in the future.
3. **`gorder` does not fully support the analysis of systems with multiple membranes.**
   - **Why is this the case?** Handling multiple membranes is complex, and such systems are relatively uncommon. `gorder` is primarily designed for analyzing single-membrane systems. This does not mean you cannot use it for multi-membrane systems, but some features may not work as expected (see below).
   - **What can you do if your system contains multiple membranes?** If you are performing basic analysis with a static membrane normal and no leaflet assignment, no special action is required. However, be aware that order parameters from all membranes will be averaged into a single collective set of order parameters. If you are assigning leaflets, note that the only usable classification method is the `individual` method (assuming the membranes are planar, since for vesicles, [you should always assign lipids to leaflets manually](manual_leaflets.md)). If you are using dynamic membrane normal calculation, ensure that the membranes are sufficiently far apart: specifically, farther than the `radius` value used in the membrane normal calculation. You can of course also select atoms from a single membrane for analysis, but make sure to consistently apply this selection across all relevant sections, particularly in dynamic membrane normal calculation.
   - **Will this be addressed in the future?** Will `gorder` ever support membrane-specific order parameter calculations? This is highly unlikely. Multi-membrane systems are rare, and membrane-wise analysis can be approximated by running individual analyses with different atom selections. Since `gorder` is fast (and even faster when the trajectory is already cached), performing multiple runs should not be a significant issue.

# Installation

Installing the `gorder` tool consists of two simple steps:

1. **Install Rust.**
    - Follow [this guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your operating system.
    - If you already have Rust installed, you can skip this step. To check, run `rustc --version`.

2. **Install `gorder`.**
    - Run `cargo install gorder` in your terminal.

You can verify that the installation was successful by running `gorder --version`. The current version of the `gorder` tool should be displayed in the terminal.

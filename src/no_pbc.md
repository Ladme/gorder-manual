# Ignoring periodic boundary conditions

`gorder` fully supports the handling of orthogonal (i.e., rectangular cuboid) periodic boundary conditions (PBC) applied in all three dimensions. If your simulation box is orthogonal and PBC are applied in all three dimensions, you can use a raw trajectory generated by Gromacs directly, without worrying about making molecules whole in the simulation box or dealing with other PBC-related issues. `gorder` will handle everything automatically.

**However**, if your simulation box is **not** orthogonal, `gorder` cannot properly treat the system and you will get an error. In such cases, you must instruct `gorder` to ignore periodic boundary conditions by adding the following line to your input YAML file:

```yaml
handle_pbc: false
```

When this option is set to `false`, `gorder` will disregard periodic boundary conditions and the presence of any simulation box. Effectively, it will treat the atoms in your system as if they exist in an infinite, unbound environment. **When ignoring PBC, it is crucial to ensure that all lipid molecules in your system are whole in every frame of the input trajectory.** If your molecules are "broken" at the box boundaries, you may silently get **completely incorrect results!** When ignoring PBC, you will always get a warning reminding you to make molecules whole:

```text
[W] Periodic boundary conditions ignored. Lipid molecules must be made whole!
```

In Gromacs, you can make molecules whole with the following command:

```bash
gmx trjconv -s TPR_FILE -f XTC_FILE -pbc mol -o OUTPUT_XTC_FILE
```

The resulting `OUTPUT_XTC_FILE` should then be used as the trajectory input for `gorder`.

You can of course choose to ignore PBC for any system, even if it has an orthogonal box.

> Note: You do not necessarily have to set `handle_pbc` to `false` when working with an orthogonal box with PBC applied in fewer than three dimensions. However, such systems are untested, so proceed with caution. In case you are not sure the analysis is correct, try using a trajectory with whole molecules, set `handle_pbc` to `false`, and check whether the results change.

## Limitations when ignoring PBC

Be aware of the following limitations when PBC are ignored:

1. **Order parameters for individual leaflets**  
   Ensure that your membrane is fully within the simulation box. For example, if your membrane lies in the xy-plane, ensure it does not extend beyond the limits of the simulation box in the z-dimension or appear fragmented across the periodic boundary. **Failing to meet this requirement may result in entirely incorrect lipid leaflet assignments.** To avoid issues, you may want to center the membrane in the simulation box before running the analysis.

2. **Ordermap dimensions**  
   When constructing ordermaps, you cannot automatically derive their dimensions from the simulation box because it is ignored. You must specify the dimensions manually. Forgetting to do this will result in an error. See [this section of the manual](ordermaps.md#dimensions-of-the-ordermaps) for instructions on setting dimensions.

3. **Reference points for geometry selections**  
   When calculating order parameters for a specific region, you cannot use the dynamic center of the simulation box as the reference point because `gorder` ignores box information. If this constraint is violated, you will get an error. However, you can still use static coordinates or the dynamic center of geometry as the reference point. If using the dynamic center of geometry, ensure that your selected atoms for center calculation are made whole, i.e., are not broken at the simulation box boundary.
